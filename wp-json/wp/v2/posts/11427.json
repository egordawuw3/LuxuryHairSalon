The salon move will involve two phases. The first phase, is moving to a temporary location on the Lower Ground of Chatswood Chase for 15-18 months. After this, we will be moving to our new, permanent location back on the Ground Floor on the Archer Street entrance. The reason we have to relocate temporarily is due to the fact that the Permanent Space will not be ready for us when our current location ceases. Both the temporary and permanent salons will exceed the space we have currently, allowing for further expansion of the salon business.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where in Chatswood Chase Luxe Concept Salon moving?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Temporary Salon: Lower Ground, towards Archer Street side of Chatswood Chase. We will be where Cancer Council and the Nail Salon was previously. Other landmark stores include Commonwealth Bank. The temporary salon will amongst the newly opened Chase Market that has already begun welcoming new fresh food vendors and dining experiences.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When is Luxe Concept Salon moving?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Our first day in our temporary salon will be <strong>Wednesday, 28th February!\u00a0<\/strong>Any appointments from this date onwards, we will be on the Lower Ground. Our last date in our current salon is Saturday 24th February as we will need a few days to move a few things downstairs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anything else I need to know?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our temporary salon is going to be bigger than our current space, which is a relief and we have definitely outgrown the salon space. Due to the configuration of the floor plan, we may lose one or two sections than what we have now. For this reason, we kindly ask that you come alone to your appointment as we may not be able to seat your loved ones or little ones.<\/li>\n<li>Allow extra time when travelling to the salon: Due to the development happening within the Chase, there may be times there are disruptions with the Carpark. Where possible, please give yourself slightly longer than normal usual when travelling to us.<\/li>\n<li>Even though it&#8217;s temporary, we are sure all of our clients we will love what we have done with the space. Our team are excited for this transition period and to create new experiences with all of our beautiful clients.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We will continue to update this space with any relevant changes as time evolves.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;re getting very excited that our Salon Relocation is only a few weeks away!
