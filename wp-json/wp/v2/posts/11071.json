Compared with traditional keratin systems, Nanoparticles contained in the treatment are approximately 750x smaller, allowing the nutrients to penetrate deeper into the hair fibre and treat the hair without opening the cuticle. Therefore, disregarding the need for an anti-residue shampoo, making it a fast &amp; effective one-step system.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Floractive&#8217;s formula contains Essential Organic Acids + Hydrolysed Vegetable Keratin that includes the innovative Ozone Protein, Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Linseed Oil, Ascorbic Acid, Acetic Acid and Lactic Acid. This revolutionary blend of ingredients increases hydration and assists in reconstructing the hair fibre while promoting hair growth without causing damage to the hair fibre.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">What Is Difference Between Nanoplasty and Traditional Keratin Treatments?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The main distinction between Keratin and Nanoplasty is the chemical composition of each treatment. Whilst the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/service\/hair-smoothing-and-relaxing\/\">Keratin treatments<\/a> we offer at Luxe do not contain Formaldehyde or other harsh chemicals, the Nanoplasty is less toxic as it is formulated with organic acids and collagen. It is free of harsh chemicals, formaldehyde releasers, carboncysteine, and other pollutants.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Additionally, unlike traditional Keratin Treatments, Nanoplasty lasts in the hair for up 8 months, as opposed to three tp six month results with older technologies. After having a Nanoplasty service, the treatment will grow out of the hair, rather than fade out.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Nanoplasty eliminates 100% of any frizz you may have had prior to the service and you will be able to wash and wear your hair straight and shiny with no to minimal heat styling. In addition to straightening the hair, the treatment repairs the hair from the inside out. It is produced with Organic Acids, A\u00e7ai, and Linseed Oil, all of which are vegan and natural.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Nanoplasty Hair Straightening FAQ&#8217;s<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Q:<\/strong> How long does it last?<br \/>\n<strong>A:<\/strong> Nanoplasty lasts 6-8 months on the hair.
