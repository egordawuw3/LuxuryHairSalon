So start the new season with a long dreamt for look &#8211; a good haircut does wonders for your hair and it always grows back, so why not take a risk?<\/p>\n<p>Luxe haircut trends are full of volume and natural movement giving an intense and free wave to hair. The challenge is to find a dynamic style that remains between femininity and rock spirit \u2013 there is nothing more timeless than an effortless, cool look.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright scale-with-grid size-medium wp-image-2493\" src=\"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/risk-1-238x300.jpg\" alt=\"risk-1\" width=\"238\" height=\"300\" \/>The long bob haircut has been a hit in the spring \/ summer 2015 fashion season, and it looks like this will continue to be a strong trend in 2016. This haircut is super modern and versatile, characterized by having a length up to 8cm off the shoulders, a straight perimeter, misaligned or asymmetrical \u2013 promising a glamorous look.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, the already known short bob is everywhere in spring &amp; summer 2015-2016 fashion trends, and is once again a hit and an inspiration for those wanting a sharp new look, always versatile and very stylish.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211;\u00a0This type of haircut does not benefit those who have a round face, as it will further accentuate the rounded face<br \/>\n&#8211; If you have a long face, short bob helps to shorten it and to look more oval<br \/>\n&#8211; This haircut integrates very well with a square face<br \/>\n&#8211; Bangs help on a better framework of this cut and may be short, long or even asymmetrical, according the need for balance. \u00a0For those who like to take risks, long bangs in degrad\u00e9 is a must!<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignright scale-with-grid size-medium wp-image-2495\" src=\"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/risk-3-248x300.jpg\" alt=\"risk-3\" width=\"248\" height=\"300\" \/>Side bangs is another big bet of spring\/summer 2015-2016 haircut trends. This is a perfect way to get a new look without having to change the length or cut of your hair. Just do a side bang and you already have a completely different look.<\/p>\n<p>But beware!
