Our days are seeming to blending into one right now &#8211; where we find ourselves checking the fridge 15 times a day, taking up some interesting hobbies and spending way more time than we should our most-loved streaming services. For some of us, we do know that time is passing by though by the ever-growing regrowth we see each time we look in the mirror.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Root Touch Up Products &#8211; The best of the best<\/h2>\n<p>While some of you might be embracing #isolife and are happy to wave the grey (or white, or other hideous regrowth colour) flag and let nature take it&#8217;s course, for others&#8217; this is just as bad as missing happy hour at our favourite bars right now &#8211; devastating. Thankfully, there are some amazing at home root touch up products to let you become your own colourist until you&#8217;re back in the chair of your favourite stylist.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the type of root coverage you need, you can choose between quick-fix products that conceal roots in between washes or more long-term options that keep roots covered for up to three weeks at a time. Whether you prefer a quick and easy spray or a colour-correcting powder or gel, these products will keep you looking like you just left the salon &#8211; even when you haven&#8217;t been in weeks.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Oribe Airbrush Root Touch Up Spray &#8211; $48.00<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-4207 size-medium alignright\" src=\"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-235x300.jpg\" alt=\"Oribe Airbrush Root Touch Up Spray\" width=\"235\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-235x300.jpg 235w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-768x978.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-804x1024.jpg 804w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-94x120.jpg 94w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-392x500.jpg 392w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-173x220.jpg 173w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-200x255.jpg 200w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-400x510.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-600x764.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified-800x1019.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/unspecified.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">An absolute cult-favourite!
