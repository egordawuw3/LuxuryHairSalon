It will leave your hair a mess in the morning&#8221; she explains.

We recommend the GHD Diffuser.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t fight the frizz too much &#8211; &#8220;A little bit of frizz can definitely work, so let your hair do it&#8217;s thing and tame it slightly using a hydrating curl product&#8221;. Erin suggests Curl Gloss by Oribe which has hydration and hold while protecting against humidity &#8211; puts a spring back in your slept in spirals.<\/li>\n<li>Moisturise your curls &#8211; This will give your coils a little bounce. It&#8217;s important to give curly hair the right amount of nutrients to tame the frizz without corrupting the natural hair. Erin&#8217;s go to&#8217;s include Davines Oi Milk which is a multi-benefit leave in treatment, and Kerastase Oleo Curl Cream which creates supple and relaxed curls.<\/li>\n<li>Wear your curls in the evening- For a more polished look, Erin recommends in starting with dry hair and using a GHD Classic Curl Tong to tweak and define your natural curls in the top layer and twist as curling. Apply Oribe Apres Beach which creates tousled beach inspired waves, giving the hair moisture and shine without the salty stiffness &#8211; perfect for anyone fantasizing about a St. Tropez night.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To those girls who dutifully straighten their strands into submission EVERY.SINGLE.MORNING, please stop.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":8759,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"footnotes":""},"categories":[7],"tags":[33],"class_list":["post-7429","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-blog","tag-update"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7429","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7429"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7429\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":12493,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7429\/revisions\/12493"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/8759"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7429"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7429"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7429"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
