We can either do tint re-growth whilst wearing Latino, or we can do foil highlights or lowlights. However, we do insist on your returning to us for colour whilst wearing our Latino Hair Straightener, otherwise we can not, of course, guarantee our work.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you do the treatment on top of relaxed hair?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes. You can do the treatment over any previously relaxed hair.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you do the treatment on highlighted hair?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes. You can do the highlights and do the treatment right after.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Can you do the treatment on virgin hair?<\/strong><br \/>\nYes.
