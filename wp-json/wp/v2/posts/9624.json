If your a true beauty junkie like us, we are almost positive you are already using a skin and body scrub in your routine, but what about your scalp?

Trust us when we say that if you care for your scalp half as much as you do for your skin you will be lead to a hair nirvana; voluminous locks, beyond-belief shine and overall scalp well-being.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<h2>Why Hair Scrubs are the Next Big Thing<\/h2>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is a Hair Scrub?<\/h3>\n<p>Only our latest hair care obsession! Our scalp is a place where we should definitely be paying attention to, it&#8217;s where our hair comes to life. The hair follicle begins four millimetres below the scalp surface and when it does come through, a nourished and healthy environment supports our hair to thrive. A scalp scrub, or scalp exfoliator, is designed to detox the scalp while removing product build up, dead skin cells and excess oil. Often powered by sea salt, sugar or AHA&#8217;s, scalp scrubs are formulated to create an optimal environment for healthy hair.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Why Is It Important To Exfoliate Your Scalp?<\/h3>\n<p>We know this is Beauty 101, but for those who are still confused of this whole scrub phenomena, exfoliation is the process of removing dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. This reveals the newer, more vital skin below. Although over time our body naturally replaces dead skins with new ones, this process can be slow and uneven. To bring it back to scalp care, using a scalp scrub will remove oil, dandruff and deeply encrusted dirt all while stimulation the scalps natural renewal process. The effect is visible from the roots all the way to the tips.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">How Do I Use A Hair Scrub?<\/h3>\n<p>While it may sound slightly daunting, scalp exfoliation is simple and leaves your tresses feeling amazing. For best results, we recommend in incorporating your hair scrub into your hair-care routine once a week, maximum twice a week to avoid causing irritation.\u00a0 Replace your first shampoo with your chosen scrub and spend a few minutes massaging into the scalp before rinsing. This is also a perfect time to follow with your favourite deep conditioning mask for a luxury hair experience at home. Use any serums and styling products as usual.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Is An Exfoliant Scrub Harsh On The Hair And Scalp?<\/h3>\n<p>A scalp scrub will not leave the hair or scalp feeling stripped or irritated if used at a correct frequency &#8211; a gentle touch is always best. One of our favourite things about scalp scrubs is that it can benefit all hair types; even those who feel their hair is dry or more sensitised than usual. As scrubs are designed to remove impurities at the roots, expect your mane to grow faster as it&#8217;s environment is being nurtured and cared for.<\/p>\n<h3>What Hair Scrub Brands are Best?<\/h3>\n<p>Not sure where to begin in deciding which hair scalp scrub is right for you?
