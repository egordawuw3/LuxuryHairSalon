Compared with traditional keratin systems, Nanoparticles contained in the treatment are approximately 750x smaller, allowing the nutrients to penetrate deeper into the hair fibre and treat the hair without opening the cuticle. Therefore, disregarding the need for an anti-residue shampoo, making it a fast &amp; effective one-step system.<\/p>\n<p>The main distinction between Keratin and Nanoplasty is the chemical composition of each treatment. Whilst the Keratin treatments we offer at Luxe do not contain Formaldehyde or other harsh chemicals, the Nanoplasty is less toxic as it is formulated with organic acids and collagen. It is free of harsh chemicals, formaldehyde releasers, carboncysteine, and other pollutants.<\/p>\n<p>Nanoplasty eliminates 100% of any frizz you may have had prior to the service and you will be able to wash and wear your hair straight and shiny with no to minimal heat styling. In addition to straightening the hair, Nanoplasty also repairs the hair from the inside out. It is produced with Organic Acids, A\u00e7ai, and Linseed Oil, all of which are vegan and natural.<\/p>\n<h3>The Nanoplasty Straightening difference:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Long lasting, straight hair for up to 8 months<\/li>\n<li>Impactful shine and gloss effect<\/li>\n<li>Eliminates 100% of frizz<\/li>\n<li>Deeply hydrates and treats hair while restoring fibre from the inside out<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All bookings, consultations and general enquiries can be arranged either <a href=\"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/contact-us\/\">by phone, online or with the Luxe staff in the salon<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Maintain your Nanoplasty straightening treatment with<a href=\"https:\/\/www.luxehairconcepts.com.au\/collections\/floractive\/products\/floractive-marroco-golden-plus-mask\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Floractive Marroco Golden Plus Mask<\/a>, the ideal hair product for those who have experienced an in-salon Nanoplasty treatment.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Nanoplasty straightening treatment eliminates 100% of any frizz you may have had prior to the service and you will be able to wash and wear your hair straight and shiny with no to minimal heat styling.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":12647,"parent":11956,"menu_order":0,"template":"","tags":[],"service-category":[],"class_list":["post-11958","service","type-service","status-publish","has-post-thumbnail","hentry"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/service\/11958","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/service"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/service"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/service\/11956"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/12647"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=11958"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=11958"},{"taxonomy":"service-category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.luxeconceptsalon.com.au\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/service-category?post=11958"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
